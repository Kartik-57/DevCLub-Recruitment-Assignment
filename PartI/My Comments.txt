- Used this to start from scartch: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK
- Video tutorial is from 2016, so it uses 'url' library but now, default library is 'Path'
  so, that took some time and looking into to fix.
- Spent an Hour trying to find whats wrong, it was a missing comma :/
- Having issues with forms, following tutorial and changing things to suit the library model
  A LOT of time wasted in debugging... :(
- Couldn't solve the form bug, skipped for now, will come back to it later
- Why doesn't anything work the first time around.
